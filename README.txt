This project is about creating antennas.
The software used for this purpose is the CST Studio Suite 2022.
The files are in ".cst" format.
This project is based upon creating a 3D microstrip patch antenna.
The design of the antenna is work upon a resonant frequency of 2.44Ghz which is a free band.
It uses Copper annealed and FR4 as ground and substrate respecyively.

****Download the CST Studio Suite before downloading any file from the repository.****

The project contains a README file that you are viewing right now, a file that reads "Important specification for antenna design" which includes antenna parameters that are important to understand while designing an antenna,and an "Antenna_2.4_planar" file which is of .cst extension and is of '104KB'.

The above files are the most important files.
There are a total of four file that i have attached for this project, out of which three are stated above and the rest of the files are a part of a folder "Antenna_2.4_planar" which is of '22.5MB' and has a total of 249 files inside of it.
The main folders in the above fourth file are "Export, Model, ModelCache, Result, SP, Temp".


Store all these files in one folder and open the "Antenna_2.4_planar" file with '.cst' extension, which has the logo of CST Software on it.
